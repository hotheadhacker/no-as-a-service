## ⛙ Contributing

1. To contribute new reasons, fork and clone locally.  
2. "No" reasons are in `reasons.json`.  To add new ones, simply add them to the end of the file, and run `npm run deduplicate` to deduplicate and sort the list (so that multiple peoples' contributions will tend not to overlap).
3. Then commit, push, and start your PR.
