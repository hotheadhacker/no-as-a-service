## 🧠 Now with LLM-powered excuses! (Optional)

If you enable LLM support and provide an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key, the excuses will be generated by an AI model for maximum hilarity.

### 🎯 Thematic Excuses

When using the LLM excuses, you can pass an optional theme to get a context-aware excuse:

```http
GET /no?theme=starwars
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "reason": "I can't join yout Lightsaber duel club today; I left my lightsaber charging in the Death Star's cathode ray tube overnight and it's still stuck in hyperspace",
  "theme": "starwars",
  "source": "llm"
}
```

## 🛠️ Self-Hosting

Want to run it yourself? It’s lightweight and simple.

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotheadhacker/no-as-a-service.git
cd no-as-a-service
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables (optional)
Create a .env file with your OpenRouter key:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

### 4. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```

The API will be live at:
```
http://localhost:3000/no
```

You can also change the port using an environment variable:
```bash
PORT=5000 npm start
```

Finally, you can adjust behavior in index.js
```js
const shouldUseLLM = true; // Toggle LLM use
const model = "meta-llama/llama-3.3-8b-instruct:free"; // Select preferred model
```
